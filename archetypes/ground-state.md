# Introduction

Write your Ground State post here. This section is for **fundamentals in science** and **philosophical perspectives** on modeling in chemistry.

## Using LaTeX Math

You can use inline math like $E = mc^2$ or display equations:

$$
\hat{H}\psi = E\psi
$$

For more complex equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} &= -\frac{i}{\hbar}[\hat{H}, \rho] \\
&= -\frac{i}{\hbar}(\hat{H}\rho - \rho\hat{H})
\end{aligned}
$$

## Structure Your Post

Use headers, lists, and formatting to make your content readable:

- **Bold** for emphasis
- *Italic* for definitions
- `code` for technical terms

## References

Add references and citations as needed.
