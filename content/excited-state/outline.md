# Excited State Content Roadmap

## 1. Experimental Frontiers
- Ultrafast and multidimensional spectroscopies revealing coupled dynamics beyond steady-state pictures.
- Multiphoton strategies (two-photon, high-harmonic, XFEL) and what questions they unlock.
- Hybrid measurement platforms (spectroscopy + scattering, spectroscopy + electrochemistry).

## 2. Making Sense of Difficult Data
- Case studies where SVD/global analysis resolve overlapping kinetics in real experiments.
- Bayesian inference and ML-based denoising for sparse, noisy signals.
- Contemporary debates about overfitting versus physical interpretability.

## 3. Electronic Structure Stories
- Applying advanced DFT/ab initio (CI, multiconfigurational, embedding) to interpret new spectra.
- Benchmarks that stress-test electronic structure approximations against experiment.
- Data-driven excited-state potential surfaces and vibronic coupling narratives.

## 4. Vibrational & Magnetic Case Files
- Resonance Raman/IR tracking structural snapshots through catalytic cycles.
- Ultrafast vibrational energy flow and coherence signatures.
- Modern EPR/NMR pulse sequences targeting transient spin states.

## 5. Kinetic Landscapes
- Linking time-resolved spectra to mechanistic models under real experimental constraints.
- Global fitting of kinetic networks in enzyme catalysis or materials switching.
- When transient species defy classical kinetics and require stochastic or quantum treatments.

## 6. Scattering in Motion
- Time-resolved X-ray scattering/crystallography, serial diffraction, and mix-and-inject schemes.
- Pump–probe electron diffraction and connections to ultrafast spectroscopy data.
- Interpreting diffuse scattering, disorder, and heterogeneous ensembles.

## 7. Modeling Uncertainty in Practice
- How limits in signal-to-noise set discovery boundaries in frontier experiments.
- Adaptive sampling, compressed sensing, and experimental design loops guided by models.
- Error bars that matter: communicating confidence in bold claims.

## 8. Computation Meets Experiment
- Molecular dynamics + spectroscopy pipelines for protein dynamics and materials aging.
- Machine learning surrogates for expensive simulations (neural force fields, differentiable spectroscopies).
- Active-learning workflows steering new measurements.

## 9. Translational Spotlights
- Protein dynamics, enzyme kinetics, and allostery stories tied to real data sets.
- Materials and energy applications (photocatalysis, quantum materials) showcasing modeling/measurement synergy.
- Community perspectives on reproducibility and data-sharing in high-end spectroscopy.

## 10. Crossovers with Ground State
- Companion pieces that map foundational principles to active case studies.
- “If you liked…” guides pointing readers from fundamentals to cutting-edge implementations.
