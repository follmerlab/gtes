# About Ground Truths & Excited States

Welcome to **Ground Truths & Excited States** — a blog exploring the intersection of fundamental science and cutting-edge research in molecular chemistry and spectroscopy.

## Ground State

These posts focus on the **fundamentals**: core principles, careful analysis, and philosophical perspectives on modeling in chemistry. Here you'll find deep dives into established methods, critiques of common assumptions, and explorations of what we really know (and don't know) about molecular systems.

## Excited State

These posts capture **hot takes**, cutting-edge results, incomplete thoughts, and time-resolved ideas. This is where speculative thinking meets experimental innovation — discussing new findings, emerging techniques, and the dynamic frontier of molecular science.

## Philosophy

Science advances through both careful foundation-building and bold exploration. This blog aims to honor both modes of thinking, recognizing that ground truths stabilize our understanding while excited states drive discovery forward.
